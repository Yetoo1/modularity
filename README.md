# modularity
The author of this script is Scott Cohen of the Huntington Beach Union Highschool District. The purpose of this is not only to be the product of a school project, but a way to easily make high performance, modular, and interchangable programs in C. 
#The way that it's setup
So like, there is a module directory by the name of Jerry and within Jerry is a series of source files. One of them is a file with m to the right of the name but before the extension. Next to the Jerry module directory is one named Sally, Sally has source files that can accomodate Jerry's and even has her info file REQ including Jerry's name. So now when t# fix this fix this fix this  
!Add the ability to read the through file to determine which one is the main module
